# MMGINCDA

We propose a new computational model, Multiple similarity and multiple kernel fusion based on graph inference network for predicting circRNA-disease associations. This is the implementation of MMGINCDA:



# Environment Requirement

    python == 3.8
    torch == 1.4.0
    torch-genometric == 1.4.2
    matplotlib == 3.5.2
    networkx == 2.8
    numpy == 1.21.6
    pandas == 1.4.2
    scipy == 1.8.0
    
# Dataset

We performed 5-fold cross validation on four datasets. Dataset1-4 are from CircR2Disease database, CircRNADisease database, Circ2Disease database, and CircR2Disease v2.0, respectively. We divided the known circRNA-disease associations into five equal parts and stored them in .txt files.
